Personal-Burndown-with-Team-Member-Selection
============================================

These are variations on the Personal Burndown Chart located in the Rally App catalog.

One version allows you to select each team member individually and see their burndown, not just your own.  
Data is presented horizontally, with a chart to the left and task grid to the right.

The second variation is the same data, but vertically stacks the chart above the grid (better in some dashboard views). 

The third variation changes the burndown bars to be "Actuals" bars - this helps determine if each user has put in their actual task time on a daily basis in environments which are using Actuals to track time.
